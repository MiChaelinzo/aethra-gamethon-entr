## 📝 Caption Writing

For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

### Good Caption Examples

✅ "Main menu showcasing 8 unique biomes across Normal and EXTREME difficulty modes"

✅ "Active gameplay demonstrating particle trail collision system with 5x score multiplier"

✅ "Educational card teaching players about solar energy and its CO₂ reduction impact"

✅ "Supernova power-up activation creating massive screen-wide effect and bonus points"

### Bad Caption Examples

❌ "Game screen" (too vague)

❌ "This shows the level select where you can pick levels" (obvious/redundant)

❌ "Screenshot 1" (not descriptive)

## 🎬 Alternative: Video Capture

If screenshots alone don't capture the experience, consider a short video:

**What to show:**

- Capture a combo chain or power-up

**Tools:**
- OBS Studio (free, powerful)
- Windows Game Bar (Win + G)
- Mac Screen Recording (Cmd + Shift + 5)
- Browser extensions (Loom, Screencastify)

**Settings:**
- 1080p resolution
